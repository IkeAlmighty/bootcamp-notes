-   **Embeded Javascript**: typing javascript in the html document between to script tags. It is NOT called inline javascript.

-   you cannot use / at the beginning of a pathname for a script src attribute

-   **template literals**:

    `Here is a template literal. 5 + 5 is ${5 + 5}.`

-   **loose comparator**: double equals sign will attempt coersion before comparing.
-   **strict comparator**: triple equals does not do coersion, so it only returns true if the type and the value are the same.
-   The Quokka js extension is super helpful for debugging.
