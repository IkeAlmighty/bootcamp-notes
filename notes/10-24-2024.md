-   fall-over: ex. with font families, we list several in CSS to use, when one font doesn't work then the next one in the family is used.

-   serif: serifs have little flared lines on them
-   sans-serif: without the little flared lines!

-   line-height: the height of the font.

-   octothorp: cool way of saying hashtag or pound-sign

-   not all semantic tags have the same default stylings, but we wish they did lmao

-   it does not matter what order you put the arguments for border property.

-   position: absolute

        position: absolute;

    uses the first parent with

          position: relative;

    as the absolute element's root coordinates (0, 0).
