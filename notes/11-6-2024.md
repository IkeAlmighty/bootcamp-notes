-   The console in most browsers doubles as a JS REPL
-   you can use the **_in_** keyword in a for of loop to get indexes instead of values:

        for (const index in array) {
            console.log("prints the index instead of the value: ${index}")
        }

-   **Hoisting**: variables and functions can be declared after they are used, and they will work just the same.
