-   pwd - print directory. This prints the directory I am in. I don't know why I never learned this over thge years because it would have helped me a lot hahahahaah

-   rm -rf : options r means recursive, f means force. adding the force flag stops the rm executable from asking you whether you want to delete each individual file.

-   git fetch - fetch just retrieves the most up to date changes but it doesn't merge locally afterward like pull does. git pull is like doing git fetch + git merge

-   semantic tags are the same except for their name. They have the same basic styling.

-   inline styles take precedence over external style sheets

-   id attributes overwrite class attributes
