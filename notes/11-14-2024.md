-   event bubbling: whenever an event is fired from the DOM, it 'bubbles' up the DOM hierarchy. So, this means that children will trigger event listeners of their parents as well:

        parent.addEventListener('click', ()=> console.log('click!'));
        child.addEventListener('click', ()=> console.log('click child!'));

Clicking on the child will also fire the click event for the parent element.

-   data attributes - element attributes that only provide data for an element and nothing else. Attributes can be accessed by javascript, and used in code to make decisions.

        <div id="myDiv" custom-attr="my custom attribute"/>

and in a link js file:

        const myDiv = document.querySelector('#myDiv');
        const customAttributeValue = myDiv.getAttribute('custom-attr');

_cusomAttributeValue_ now contains the value 'my custom attribute'
