-   you can use attribute selectors to select based on the content of an attribute.

         tagname[attribute="value"] //equal to 'value'
         tagname[attribute*="value"] //contains 'value'
         tagname[attribute$="value"] //ends with 'value'

-   always stick variables in the :root selector
-   always put the :root selector at the top of the styles page so that other selectors know about it
