# project 1 notes

-   agile - quick and well coordinated, lively, thinking quick, aware
-   agile in software development - Code -> Build -> Test -> Release -> Deploy -> Operate -> Monitor -> Plan. The idea is to make small mistakes often, so that you don't make large mistakes occasionally that destroy the project

-   MVP - Minimum Viable Product
-   Issues - via github we can create issues to track bugs in the project
-   exit

-   each day we should have a daily SCRUM
