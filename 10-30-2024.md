-   browser's default css values are different across browsers
-   this is why we use _css resets_
-   line-height property does not need a unit. Whenever you don't specify a unit, it becomes a multiple of the default line-height;
-   psuedo-classes are what you call selectors for :hover, :active, :visited, etc
-   emmett abbreviations can help me type faster
-   when selecting children with **CSS combinators**:
    space = AND > = the specified child only + = the specified child that IMMEDIETLY follows the parent
-   **TOOL TIPS USING PSUEDO ELEMENTS** if you make a parent element relative, you can create a tool tip by using

          parent:hover::after {
              position: relative;
              content: 'tooltip text'
              top: 1rem;
              left: 0;
              background-color: white;
              border: 1px solid black;
          }

This creates a psuedo element after the parent element.
