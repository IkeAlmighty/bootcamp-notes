-   pwd - print directory. This prints the directory I am in. I don't know why I never learned this over thge years because it would have helped me a lot hahahahaah

-   rm -rf : options r means recursive, f means force. adding the force flag stops the rm executable from asking you whether you want to delete each individual file.
