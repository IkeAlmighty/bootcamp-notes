<h1>Acceptance Criteria and User Story</h1>
<p>These concepts are helpful for planning and staying on track for any development project.</p>
<p>Acceptance Criteria - A set of requirements that a project or feature needs to meet in order to be considered functional. Acceptance Criteria is meant to help manage expectations between the developers and whatever party is reponsible for coming up with the idea for the application. Sometimes, the developers ARE the people coming up with the feature (think indie developers), in which case Acceptance Criteria is simply a guideline for making sure the project stays on track.</p>
<p>Sometimes Acceptance Criteria is also called &quot;Definition of Done&quot;.</p>
<p>Acceptance Criteria can be written following a GIVEN, WHEN, THEN template.</p>
<pre><code>GIVEN [insert user story element]
WHEN [user interacts with app in certain way]
THEN [describe feature element]
</code></pre>
<p>WHEN and THEN can be repeated for each feature. The WHEN describes the use condition of the feature, while the THEN describes the functionality of the feature. GIVEN should describe the overarching goal of the user when using the application.</p>
<p>User Story - an informal, natural language description of the features (or a feature) in a software system. A user story is usually written form the perspective of an end user because this  (hopefully) puts the writer of the story in the mindset of the user instead of the creator of the feature. While Acceptance Criteria is written often from the position of a task delegator on the development team, the user story is what informs what the Acceptance Criteria looks like.</p>
