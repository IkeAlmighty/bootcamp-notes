<p>typescript types:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>primitives: string, boolean, number, null, undefined</p>
</li>
<li><p>special: any, never</p>
</li>
<li><p>non-primitives: Arrays, Objects</p>
</li>
<li><p>note: null and undefined are both types and values</p>
</li>
<li><p>void: there will never be a type</p>
</li>
<li><p>unknown: is a special type that allows a variable type to be assigned at first assignment</p>
</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>&quot;narrowing&quot;: when we check the type of a number before we use it so we know we&#39;re using the right way</li>
<li>you can use OR pipe with a single pipe | to let arrays contain multiple types</li>
<li>adding a void type to a function&#39;s return type results in th</li>
</ul>
