<h1>UTF-8</h1>
<p>UTF-8 is used as the primary character set for the web. It supports most languages in existence, which is why the total size of the full UTF table is 1,112,064. </p>
<p>UTF-8 encodings are represented by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8">&quot;four one byte (8-bit) code units&quot;</a>. So each UTF-8 encoding is a total of 32 bits long.</p>
<p>So, when you see a character in a web browser, you now know that the computer reads it as an encoding on thr UTF-8 encoding table, and the browser simply uses this table to lookup the character and render it appropriately.</p>
<h2>Bonus: &#39;lang&#39; attribute of the HTML tag</h2>
<p>This is tangential to UTF-8, but when a browser interprets the &#39;lang&#39; attribute on an html tag, this helps the browser filter for certain languages on web searches. </p>
<p>An html document will still be rendered just fine regardless of the lang attribute&#39;s value, but signifying the natural language is super helpful for making your website more accessible to other programs!</p>
