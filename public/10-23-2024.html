<ul>
<li><p>pwd - print directory. This prints the directory I am in. I don&#39;t know why I never learned this over thge years because it would have helped me a lot hahahahaah</p>
</li>
<li><p>rm -rf : options r means recursive, f means force. adding the force flag stops the rm executable from asking you whether you want to delete each individual file.</p>
</li>
<li><p>git fetch - fetch just retrieves the most up to date changes but it doesn&#39;t merge locally afterward like pull does. git pull is like doing git fetch + git merge</p>
</li>
<li><p>semantic tags are the same except for their name. They have the same basic styling.</p>
</li>
<li><p>inline styles take precedence over external style sheets</p>
</li>
<li><p>id attributes overwrite class attributes</p>
</li>
</ul>
