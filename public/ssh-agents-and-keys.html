<h1>SSH Keys and SSH Agents</h1>
<p>The tools used:</p>
<ul>
<li>ssh-keygen</li>
<li>ssh-agent</li>
<li>github</li>
</ul>
<p>These are notes for setting up ssh keys with your github account so future pushes of projects to github via git will be properly authenticated.</p>
<ol>
<li>use ssh-keygen to create a private and public key</li>
<li>use ssh-agent to register your new key on your local machine</li>
<li>in the settings on github, add the public key.</li>
</ol>
<p>It makes sense that public keys are used on the remote end of security systems, because remote ends are more likely to have the data leaked.</p>
