<h3>Gitflow terms</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>main/production branch</strong> - This is where the most stable version of the project code lives, and also often sometimes where the production code lives. It is the base branch for the develop branch.</li>
<li><strong>develop branch</strong> - This is the base branch for feature and release branches.</li>
<li><strong>feature branch</strong> - A feature branch is where new features are developed. Once the feature is fully developed, it is merged into the develop branch and the feature branch is deleted.</li>
<li><strong>release branch</strong> - A release branch is created with the devlop branch as it&#39;s base. Code reviews are generally done on the release branch, and if all the reviews are passed then it is merged into the main/production branch.</li>
<li><strong>hotfix branch</strong> - a hotfix branch uses the main/production branch as it&#39;s base branch. Hotfixes branches are created when a feature that has already passed code review and been merged into main/production needs corrected.</li>
